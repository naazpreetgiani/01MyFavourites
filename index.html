      I love music, because there are many different types that can make me feel
      content at any time. My favourite music genre is rap, but I also love soul
      music, R&B, hip-hop, pop, and many other genres.

      My favourite movie is Matilda, directed by Danny DeVito. This movie is
      based on Roald Dahl's novel, Matilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love the movie because it depeicts an overlooked child and the struggles
      she was put through growing up, and her overcoming them.
